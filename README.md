# ANNDL-TimeSeriesForecasting

The repository shows the models implemented for the Time Series Forecasting challenge of the course "Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning" held at Politecnico di Milano (A.Y. 2021-2022).

The challenge consisted in the forecasting of different time series. The [final best model](Seq2SqeModel/BestModel_Stacked_Seq2Seq) developed by me and other 2 collegues exploits the Seq2Seq model.

Check out the final [report](Report_Challenge_2.pdf).
